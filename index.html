            <p>Hey my name is Matthew Clifford and I am from Pocatello, Idaho. I love to read and play board games. My favorite author is Brandon Sanderson and my favorite book series of his is the Mistborn series. I love most board games made by Stonemaier games and my favorite board game genres are engine builders and deck builders. I love to go skiing in the winter and I enjoy jet skiing in the summer, as well as biking.</p>
